# Improving Vertical Detail in Simulated Temperature and Humidity Data Using Machine Learning

This repository includes the code used for our project _"Improving Vertical Detail in Simulated Temperature and Humidity Data Using Machine Learning"_ which uses ML-based Super-Resolution techniques to increase the vertical resolution of intra-model temperature and humidity profiles with the aim of improving the respresentation of thin clouds and their effects in our weather and climate models.
